If you are looking for a way to keep track of yours and others thoughts on TechRadar's newest news, then look no further! Written notes, which can be added after clicking on an article, are written to a Mongo Database and therefore persistent between sessions. The page will update upon reload to ensure you have the newest articles, and notes are updated without reload. Enjoy!
